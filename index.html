                                        <p style= "white-space:normal">This page is a fan-made story generator for the boardgame Street Masters from Blacklist Games,
                                            and is not affiliated with Blacklist Games. A story in Street Masters is a series of several narratively linked stages that a fixed group of
                                            fighters play through. Each story is guided by a story deck that contains story stage cards and
                                            other auxiliary cards. The fighter decks of the game have their own hero stories that can be
                                            played within any regular story. Together these bring about a small narrative campaign with some
                                            character development. I believe the strength of the game system, however, is in the modular
                                            nature of the game, in the way the enemy and stage decks and other game components can be
                                            combined for endless combinations of play experiences. The stories that come with the game and
                                            its expansions by necessity can not support this modularity, but I enjoy the character
                                            development and narrative gaming.</p>

                                        <p style= "white-space:normal">This generator attempts to combine the modularity of the game with the narrative character
                                            development experience by making a list of random stage and enemy combinations, and adding other
                                            game parameters, like allies, rivals and alternative victory conditions on top of those, and
                                            then tying them up with a somewhat logical narrative. You also get random fighters for the
                                            chosen player count, and the allies and rivals should you choose to use either of those. It
                                            avoids too much stage repetition, taking into account the stages in the fighters' hero stories.
                                            It can also alter the length of the story to player preferences. I would suggest choosing no
                                            less than 3 stages for most stories if playing with hero stories. Picking just 1 stage makes the
                                            generator work as a randomizer for an arcade mode game, though!</p>

                                            from the game and its expansions, remixed with other texts to make them appropriate for the
                                            given enemy. Additional texts are borrowed from games, films and cartoons, mostly for villain
                                            dialogue. By necessity, there are also texts written by myself. The generator cannot produce
                                            exact copies of the official stories, but can of course occasionally get quite close. Of the released game content, the generator is missing most of Aftershock-related content, as I
                                            do not have access to those at this time.</p>
